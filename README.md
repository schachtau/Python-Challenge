In this project python is our tool to perform two main tasks-

1. It uses financial data from a CSV file to pinpoint the number of months, the total amount of profit/loss, the average change in profit/loss, and finally tells us the greatest increase and decrease in profits.

2. The code analyzes election data from a CSV file to calculate the total number of votes therefore the winner, and display the percentage of votes for each candidate.

The results of both analyses are in separate text files.

The financial analysis includes the following details:

Total Months: The number of months in the dataset.
Total: The total amount of profit/loss over all the months.
Average Change: The average change in profit/loss over the entire period.
Biggest Increase in Profits: The month with the largest increase in profit, along with the amount.
Worst Decrease in Profits: The month with the largest decrease in profit, along with the amount.

The election analysis includes the following details:

Total Votes: The total number of votes cast in the election.
For each candidate: The candidate's name, the percentage of votes received, and the total number of votes.
Winner: The name of the candidate who won the election.
